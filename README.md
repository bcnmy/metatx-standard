# Generalized Meta Transaction

Repository containing a gas cost-effective standard for meta transaction to be used by any contract to enable native meta transaction feature on any function.
The approach support signed typed messages so that while signing the data on client-side, user sees a human readable message instead of scary hex string.

You can see the LIVE DEMO <a href="https://dapp.biconomy.io/" target="_blank" >Here</a>(works on Kovan)

The standard is the result of an initiative by Metamask here https://medium.com/metamask/announcing-a-generalized-metatransaction-contest-abd4f321470b

Biconomy was selected as one of the finalist in the hackathon. Read <a href="https://medium.com/metamask/our-metatransaction-hackathon-winner-a620551ccb9b" target="_blank">here</a>

<h3>How do i use this in my Smart Contracts?</h3>

1. Inherit <a href="https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard/blob/master/src/contracts/EIP712MetaTransaction.sol" target="_blank" >EIP712MetaTransaction</a> contract
2. Use msgSender() method where ever you were using msg.sender

<h3>How do i use this in my client code?</h3>
In order to execute meta transactions you just need to call
executeMetaTransaction(address userAddress, bytes memory functionSignature, bytes32 sigR, bytes32 sigS, uint8 sigV)
inherited from EIP712MetaTransaction.sol
<br/>

userAddress       => externally owned address of the user eg the user address in his metamask wallet<br/>

functionSignature => ABI encoding of function name with its parameter. Use web3 <a href="https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.4/web3-eth-contract.html#methods-mymethod-encodeabi" target="_blank" >encodeABI</a> method here

sigR              => 32 bytes r part of the signature

sigS              => 32 bytes s part of the signature

sigV              => integer v part of the signature


r,s,v can be calculated using web3 <a href="https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v2.0.0-alpha/web3-utils.html#getsignatureparameters" target="_blank" >getSignatureParameters</a> utility method.

Since this standard supports <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712" target="_blank" >EIP-712</a> so signature parameters should be generated using eth_signTypedData_v3 or eth_signTypedData_v4 JSON RPC method.

<h3>How to Run test cases</h3>

<h5>Setup</h5>
Rename .secret.example to .secret and add 12 word mnemonic string in the first line<br/><br/>

NOTE: Make sure you have nodejs version > 12.0.0 <br/>
1. Hardcode the `chainId()` at line 28 in EIP712Base.sol to the specific network Id e.g 42 for Kovan etc.
2. Similarly, change the same networkId as above in `EIP712MetaTransaction.test.js` at line 146.
3. Run `npm install` command to install all the dependencies
4. Run `ganache-cli` in separate cmd/terminal to run ganache client
5. At last, Run `npm run test` to run all the test cases.

<h3>How to get test coverage</h3>

1. Hardcode the `chainId()` at line 28 in EIP712Base.sol to the specific network Id e.g. 42 for Kovan etc.
2. Similarly, change the same networkId as above in `EIP712MetaTransaction.test.js` at line 146.
3. Run `npm install` command to install all the dependencies
4. Run `ganache-cli` in separate cmd/terminal to run ganache client
5. At last, Run `npm run coverage` to get test coverage report

This repository is basic implementation of Native Meta Transactions. This reposiory will be updated as per the <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1776" target="_blank">EIP-1776</a> to implement native meta transactions with support of batching, transaction expiry etc
